# Billiard Ball Tracking

This program detects the cue ball and object balls in a video of a pool game, tracking their
movements and drawing their trajectories on the video. The program’s main features include precise
detection of the cue and object balls, real-time trajectory tracking, and drawing these trajectories on
the video for clear visualization. 

My inspiration for this project came from my passion for pool billiard and my interest in the
intersection of sports and technology, as well as my desire to apply my knowledge in computer
vision. This project not only reflects my interests but also contributes to my personal and
professional growth by showcasing my technical skills and innovative capabilities in sports
technology.

This project is a personal Final Project for the course ENG 301 – Computer Vision at Fulbright University Vietnam - Spring 2024 Semester
